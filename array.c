/* Introduction to Arrays
Definition of Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory.
Syntax: Declaring and initializing arrays in C (int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};).
Why Use Arrays?: Simplifies handling multiple variables of the same type.
Basic Operations:
Accessing elements via index.
Modifying array values.
Memory Layout: How arrays are stored in memory.
30:00–1:15:00: Array Traversal and Manipulation
Looping Through Arrays: Using for and while loops for traversal.
Common Tasks:
Finding maximum/minimum.
Calculating the sum or average of elements.
Boundary Errors: Risks of accessing elements out of bounds.
Dynamic Input: Accepting user input to populate arrays.
1:15:00–2:00:00: Multidimensional Arrays
2D Arrays: Syntax (int matrix[3][3];) and applications (e.g., matrices, grids).
3D Arrays and Beyond: Conceptual understanding.
Row-Major vs. Column-Major Storage.
Applications:
Representing tables and matrices.
Simple image processing.
2:00:00–2:45:00: Advanced Topics
Pointers and Arrays: Relation between arrays and pointers.
Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Using malloc() and free() for dynamic arrays.
Passing Arrays to Functions:
By reference vs. by value.
Examples of function prototypes and implementations.
2:45:00–3:30:00: Problem Solving with Arrays
Practical Examples:
Sorting (Bubble, Selection, etc.).
Searching (Linear, Binary).
Real-world problems (e.g., histogram generation, frequency counters).
Debugging Tips:
Identifying memory issues.
Tools like gdb*/.
