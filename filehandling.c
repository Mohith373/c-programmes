/*0:00–30:00: Introduction to File Handling
What is File Handling?: Mechanism to read/write data to files.
Types of Files:
Text files (.txt).
Binary files (.bin).
Why Use Files?:
Persistent data storage.
Handling large datasets.
File Operations:
Opening (fopen()).
Closing (fclose()).
File Modes:
Read ("r"), Write ("w"), Append ("a"), and their variations.
30:00–1:15:00: Reading and Writing to Text Files
Text File Basics:
Writing data (fprintf() or fputc()).
Reading data (fscanf() or fgetc()).
End-of-File (EOF): Detecting the end of a file.
Practical Examples:
Writing user input to a file.
Reading and displaying file content line by line.
Error Handling:
Using NULL to check file opening failures.
1:15:00–2:00:00: Binary Files
Difference Between Text and Binary Files:
Binary stores data as raw bytes, faster and smaller in size.
Working with Binary Files:
Writing (fwrite()).
Reading (fread()).
Applications:
Saving structured data like images or records.
Understanding file pointers.
2:00:00–2:45:00: Advanced Topics
File Pointer (FILE*):
Understanding file streams.
Seeking positions (fseek(), ftell(), rewind()).
Appending to Files:
Using "a" mode to add content without overwriting.
Buffering:
Concepts of file buffering and performance impact.
2:45:00–3:30:00: Problem Solving with File Handling
Real-World Use Cases:
Logging system data.
Saving and retrieving user profiles.
Implementing a mini database using files.
Debugging Tips:
Verifying paths.
Handling corrupted files.
Common Mistakes:
Forgetting to close files.
Writing incorrect modes.*/
